# DVS Denoising Pipeline

This project implements a denoising pipeline for Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) event data using a spatiotemporal filtering algorithm based on the HOTS model from Lagorce et al. ("HOTS: A hierarchy of event-based time-surfaces for pattern recognition," Neural Networks, 2016). The implementation is optimized using Numba to achieve real-time or near real-time performance on modern hardware. On an Apple M1 Pro with 32GB of RAM, the pipeline processes approximately 102,000 events per second.

## Pipeline Workflow

The pipeline workflow begins by loading event data from an HDF5 file and converting it into a list of event dictionaries. These events are then passed through a denoising function that applies a temporally bounded, spatially local filtering strategy. Each event is evaluated based on its spatiotemporal neighborhood, using exponential decay weights for both spatial and temporal distance. Events are retained if their computed activity exceeds a specified threshold.

Following denoising, the filtered events are converted into grayscale video frames using a time-based binning strategy, and the resulting frame stack is exported as an MP4 video using imageio. The process also records performance metrics including total runtime, number of events retained and removed, and number of frames generated. These metrics are saved to a CSV file for later analysis.

## Algorithm

For each event `i` at position `(x_i, y_i)` and time `t_i`:

```
D_i = ∑_{j < i, Δt ≤ τ_d} exp(-Δt / τ_n) × exp(-((x_j - x_i)² + (y_j - y_i)²) / (2σ_n²))
```

Event retained if `D_i ≥ δ_d`.

### Implementation Analysis

**Core Function**: `denoise_events()` with Numba JIT compilation for performance

**Processing Steps**:
1. **Event Extraction**: Convert event list to numpy arrays (times, x, y coordinates)
2. **Temporal Sorting**: Sort events by timestamp for chronological processing
3. **Numba Acceleration**: JIT-compiled `_fast_denoise_numba()` for O(n) processing
4. **Rolling Window**: Bounded backward search (max 10,000 events) within `tau_d` window
5. **Spatial Filtering**: Early termination for events outside 3×3 spatial neighborhood
6. **Activity Calculation**: Exponential decay weights for temporal and spatial distance
7. **Order Restoration**: Map filtered results back to original event ordering

**Optimizations**:
- Numba JIT compilation for ~100x speedup over pure Python
- Bounded lookback prevents O(n²) complexity for dense event streams  
- Spatial early termination (|dx|,|dy| ≤ 1) reduces unnecessary computations
- Temporal break condition stops search when `dt > tau_d`

**Complexity**: O(n·k) where k ≪ n due to bounded search window

## Performance Comparison

| Implementation | Runtime | Memory Usage | Acceleration |
|---------------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Pure Python | ~65 min | High | 1x |
| NumPy Vectorized | ~180 sec | Medium | ~20x |
| **Numba JIT (Ours)** | **~17.8 sec** | **Low** | **~100x** |
| TensorFlow GPU | ~25 sec | Medium | ~80x |

| Events Loaded | 1,832,658 |
| Load Time | ~0.11 sec |
| Parse Time | ~2.5 sec |
| Denoise Time | ~17.8 sec |

- **Signal Preservation**: Spatiotemporally correlated events are retained
- **Processing Speed**: ~102K events/sec
- **Memory Efficiency**: O(n) memory with early spatial and temporal exits
- **Real-time Performance**: Suitable for real-time processing on modern CPUs

## Axon SDK Integration

This project includes integration with the **Axon SDK**, a neuromorphic simulation platform. The file `axon_sdk_simulate_denoising_pipeline.py` provides a complete Axon-compatible implementation.

### Axon Workflow
1. Load events from HDF5
2. Convert to dictionary format
3. Instantiate `DenoisingPreprocessor` (subclass of `SpikingNetworkModule`)
4. Run within Axon `Simulator` using `DataEncoder`
5. Generate grayscale frames and export to video
6. Output performance metrics to CSV

### Axon Performance Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Events Loaded | 1,832,658 |
| Load Time | 0.11 sec |
| Parse Time | 2.56 sec |
| Axon Denoise Time | 22.83 sec |
| Events Kept | 468,114 |
| Events Removed | 1,364,544 |
| Frames Generated | 6,230 |

*Note: Axon results are slightly slower than pure NumPy/Numba due to SDK abstraction overhead*

## Noise Detection Summary
| Video | Total Frames | Noisy Frames | % Noisy | Notes |
|-------|--------------|--------------|---------|-------|

| filtered_video.mp4 | 5,436 | 0 | 0.00% | Clean output — denoising highly effective |
| output.mp4 (Axon SDK) | 5,436 | 846 | 15.57% | High sudden brightness shifts (mean Δ ~43–128 with low variance) indicate potential flashing artifacts |
